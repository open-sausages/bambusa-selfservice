# Bambusa Self Service additions

Enables operation of [bambusa-installer](https://github.com/silverstripe/bambusa-installer)
in the Docker-based environments which are created through self-service
requests on silverstripe.com/demo.

Separated out to keep the main bambusa project easy to reuse
for custom tailored demos which might not run in those enviroments.
